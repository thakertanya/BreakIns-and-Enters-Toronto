# BreakIns-and-Enters-Toronto

We carried out an analysis on the open source data set provided to us from the Toronto Police Service. This data set contains information on break-in and enters for the population of Toronto. We analysed this data set to shed some light on the spatial and temporal significance in regards to break-in and enters. In this process, we looked at specific situations that would be useful for the TPS when handling B&Eâ€™s. This dataset is a subset of the Major Crime Indicators (MCI) and the data has been collected throughout 2014 to 2019.

The questions we are looking to find answers to are:
1 Is the proportion of break-in and enters in commercial buildings 0.3?
2 Is the number of break-ins during the day the same as the number of break-ins during the night?
3 What is the average time it takes to report a break-in in hours after the occurrence?

We used single proportion hypothesis testing, randomized hypothesis testing, bootstrap sampling and linear regression to answer all the questions above.
